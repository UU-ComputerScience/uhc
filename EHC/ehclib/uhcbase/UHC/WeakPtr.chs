Interface to WeakPtr.
No useful functionality is provided however, just the interface.

Not yet clear what this is supposed to do, but provide the interface, forgetting the finalizer stuff.

mkWeakPtrForeignEnv :: k -> v -> Addr -> Addr -> Int -> Addr -> WeakPtr v
mkWeakPtrForeignEnv k v finalizer pointer hasEnv env = mkWeakPtr k v (return ())
