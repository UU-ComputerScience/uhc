-- Buffers

-- The buffer is represented by a mutable variable containing a
-- record, where the record contains the raw buffer and the start/end
-- points of the filled portion.  We use a mutable variable so that
-- the common operation of writing (or reading) some data from (to)
-- the buffer doesn't need to modify, and hence copy, the handle
-- itself, it just updates the buffer.  

-- There will be some allocation involved in a simple hPutChar in
-- order to create the new Buffer structure (below), but this is
-- relatively small, and this only has to be done once per write
-- operation.

-- The buffer contains its size - we could also get the size by
-- calling sizeOfMutableByteArray on the raw buffer, but that tends
-- to be rounded up to the nearest Word.

-- INVARIANTS on a Buffer:
--
--   * A handle *always* has a buffer, even if it is only 1 character long
--     (an unbuffered handle needs a 1 character buffer in order to support
--      hLookAhead and hIsEOF).
--   * r <= w
--   * if r == w, then r == 0 && w == 0
--   * if state == WriteBuffer, then r == 0
--   * a write buffer is never full.  If an operation
--     fills up the buffer, it will always flush it before 
--     returning.
--   * a read buffer may be full as a result of hLookAhead.  In normal
--     operation, a read buffer always has at least one character of space.

-- Buffering modes

-- | Three kinds of buffering are supported: line-buffering, 
-- block-buffering or no-buffering.  These modes have the following
-- effects. For output, items are written out, or /flushed/,
-- from the internal buffer according to the buffer mode:
--
--  * /line-buffering/: the entire output buffer is flushed
--    whenever a newline is output, the buffer overflows, 
--    a 'System.IO.hFlush' is issued, or the handle is closed.
--
--  * /block-buffering/: the entire buffer is written out whenever it
--    overflows, a 'System.IO.hFlush' is issued, or the handle is closed.
--
--  * /no-buffering/: output is written immediately, and never stored
--    in the buffer.
--
-- An implementation is free to flush the buffer more frequently,
-- but not less frequently, than specified above.
-- The output buffer is emptied as soon as it has been written out.
--
-- Similarly, input occurs according to the buffer mode for the handle:
--
--  * /line-buffering/: when the buffer for the handle is not empty,
--    the next item is obtained from the buffer; otherwise, when the
--    buffer is empty, characters up to and including the next newline
--    character are read into the buffer.  No characters are available
--    until the newline character is available or the buffer is full.
--
--  * /block-buffering/: when the buffer for the handle becomes empty,
--    the next block of data is read into the buffer.
--
--  * /no-buffering/: the next input item is read and returned.
--    The 'System.IO.hLookAhead' operation implies that even a no-buffered
--    handle may require a one-character buffer.
--
-- The default buffering mode when a handle is opened is
-- implementation-dependent and may depend on the file system object
-- which is attached to that handle.
-- For most implementations, physical files will normally be block-buffered 
-- and terminals will normally be line-buffered.
