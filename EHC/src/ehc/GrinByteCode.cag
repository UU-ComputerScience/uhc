%%% Link Chain
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

20090923. New representation of linking info. Instead of separate tables
pointing to locations in the code, this variant uses a linked list of
entries inside the code. This is much more C code space efficient,
because no separate tables are required and the list can be overwritten
with the actual entries.

Each entry in the code consists of one word only, which both encodes the
next entry and the payload. If this does not fit, an entry in an
indirection table is used.

Each entry is keyed by a kind and location (label), later to be translated
to a separate list for each kind, each ordered by code location of the labels,
where the next entry is encoded by an offset relative to the current.

The definition of LinkChainKind must corespond with the defines
GB_LinkChainKind_XXX in src/rts/base/types.
