%%% Remove lazy bound lambdas, part 2 of 2
%%%
%%% Second part of transformation, updates call sites.
%%% Note that the input to this second part is not a Type Correct program.
%%% 
%%% For example:
%%% > let id = \x -> |x|
%%% >     id :: {Int} -> Int
%%% > in |id|
%%% 
%%% Becomes:
%%% > let id = \x -> |x|
%%% >     id :: {Int} -> Int
%%% > in id
