%%% Annotations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An annotation is an immutable, opaque value attached to certain components of a type. Each
annotation is globally distinguishable and can be used as a key to some property in an
environment. This is a design decision: we could have stored properties directly on the
annotation, but that requires updating of the annotation of the type, and we rather keep
an annotation immutable, and propably it's also easier to add new properties to an
annotation by introducing yet another environment, than adding and maintaining an
additional field to the Annotation data type.

The phantom parameter is intended to reflect the type the annotation is put on,
such that we can restrict certain operations on annotations to specific
annotations. And make sure that we do not, by accident, mix annotations of
different type.
