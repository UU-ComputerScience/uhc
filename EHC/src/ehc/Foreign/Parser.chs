Parse a foreign entity.
Parsing is parameterized with:

\begin{itemize}
\item The calling convention (encoded by @FFIWay@), determines which parser is used as the syntax depends on the calling convention.

\item A name, to be used when a name is absent. This feature is to be used for a first parse only, after that the name should be explicitly specified.
This is to cater for @ccall@ calling convention which allows (e.g.) an include file only (taken from library module @Foreign.Marshall.Utils@):
\begin{pre}
foreign import ccall unsafe "string.h" memcpy  :: Ptr a -> Ptr a -> CSize -> IO (Ptr a)
\end{pre}

\end{itemize}

These parsers are only used by the HS frontend to parse the string holding the import/export entity of a foreign function
to a corresponding abstract syntax.
