%%% Haskell importable interface to Foreign extraction info
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%[doesWhat doclatex
Extract various info out of the FFI declaration:
\begin{itemize}
\item files to include, whatever that means for a calling convention.
\item entity name itself.
\item options: is it a pointer to something (instead of something to call), is it static.
\end{itemize}
