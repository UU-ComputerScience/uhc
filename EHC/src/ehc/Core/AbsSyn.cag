Design for multiple variations of same binding.

The aim is to be able to express
\begin{itemize}
\item [Idea only] The difference between code and closure wrapped around the code
\item Variants of code accepting different calling conventions, or other features (i.e. explicit stack tracing)
\end{itemize}

Design particular(itie)s:
\begin{itemize}
\item (HsName,ACoreBindAspectKeyS) pair (encoded as ACoreBindRef) is used to refer to values,
\item [Idea only] CValTy describes some of its runtime structure. A type, but reflecting early representational choices
\item [Idea only] Redundancy: ACoreBindAspectKey_Strict only goes with CValTy_Boxed
\item a ACoreBindAspectKey_Strict implies always a ACoreBindAspectKey_Default for the same name
\end{itemize}

Extensibility at:
\begin{itemize}
\item ACoreBindAspectKey, additional alternatives describing extra aspects of a binding
\item [Idea only] CValTyProp, additional typing expressivity for a boxed value
\end{itemize}
