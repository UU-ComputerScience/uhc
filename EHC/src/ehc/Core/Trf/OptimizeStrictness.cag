%%% Use strictness info injected by strictness analysis to optimize

%%[doesWhat doclatex
Exploit strictness analysis results.

Specific transformations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Split definitions into worker/wrapper.
\item Eagerly evaluate when allowed.
\item Avoid evaluation when not necessary.
\end{itemize}
