%%% Add explicit stack trace
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%[doesWhat doclatex
Add an explicit stack trace as described by \textit{Finding the needle: stack traces for GHC}, Haskell Symposium 2009, Allwood et.al.

For now, differences are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do it globally, for all modules, thereby losing sharing for CAFs.
\end{itemize}

Note: currently this trf is placed after renaming identifiers to unique names. It therefore must maintain the unique naming invariant.
However, ideally, this trf should be placed before that, but this currently breaks.
