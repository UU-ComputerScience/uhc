%%% Code generation for CoreRun
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%[doesWhat doclatex
Construct a more efficient CoreRun representation assuming a memory model where
\begin{itemize}
\item each module has an index, each entry an index into the module
\item each lambda starts a new frame, holding also let bindings local to it, indexed by level and offset
\item each case alternative opens a constructor of which fields are referred to by scrutinee + field offset
\end{itemize}

Offsets start at 0.
