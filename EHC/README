The Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC)
==================================

This is the top directory of the UHC source tree, for the compiler and
the tools and libraries required to build UHC. UHC grew out of the
Essential Haskell Compiler (EHC) project, but the name EHC will
gradually not be used overtime. The web entry point for information
about UHC is:

	http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC/WebHome

Here the elaborate instructions for getting started and downloading can
be found. The short version for installing uhc (from either binary or
source distribution) is:

	./configure
	make				# optional
	make install		# may require admin permission

More detailed information currently still labeled with EHC can be found
